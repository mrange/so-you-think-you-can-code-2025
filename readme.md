# 🎄✨🎉 So You Think You Can Code? - 2025 Advent Calendar 🎉✨🎄

## 🌐 About This Calendar

Welcome, fellow digital architects, pixel tinkerers, and code wizards!

Inspired by the success of the **[Shader Advent Calendar 2024](https://github.com/mrange/shader-advent-2024)** arranged by the astute coder Mårten Rånge (@mrange), I'm expanding the scope to welcome a wider range of topics. This year, we're throwing open the doors to **all things geeky, code, web, demoscene, and retro—whatever coding-related things** spark your joy!

The **"So You Think You Can Code? - 2025 Advent Calendar"** is a month-long celebration of digital creativity. Each day from **December 1st to 25th**, we'll unwrap a new "door" revealing a unique, educational, and engaging contribution from the community.

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

The scope is wide open! If it involves clever code, a geeky concept, or a cool trick, we want to see it. Submissions should be **small, self-contained, and easily shareable**.

| Category | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🌐 Web Projects** | Tiny helper functions in **TypeScript/JavaScript**, clever **CSS** animations, lightweight **backend** logic, or neat browser API usage/apps. |
| **🤖 Hardware & Embedded** | Code for **microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico)**, basic robotics, I/O programming, or clever **device** hacks. |
| **🎨 Demoscene & Graphics** | **Shader Art** (GLSL/HLSL/WGSL), procedural generation, visualizers, or small canvas/WebGL experiments. |
| **🔧 Code Tricks & Tips** | A powerful utility function in **Rust, Python, or Go**, a clever algorithm implementation, or a smart deployment trick. |
| **🔓 Hacking & Security** | Ethical explorations of algorithms, simple encryption/decryption routines, or explanations of reverse engineering concepts. |
| **💾 Retro Computing** | Assembly/BASIC code for old platforms (e.g., **C64, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Atari, MS-DOS PC**), retro palettes, emulation notes, or hardware tricks. |
| **💡 Open for Suggestions!** | **Don't see your topic here?** Pitch it! We welcome any other geeky coding ideas! |
