# 💾 Behind Today’s Door: Lost Frequencies — The 8-Bit Remix

## *Recreating a Hit Song on an 8-Bit Sound Chip*
**By Ben (Nordischsound)**

My musical journey began in 2001 at the age of 18. Like many modern producers, I started entirely in the digital realm using **FL Studio**. While I still use it today for mastering, in 2020 I discovered a "new" playground that changed everything: the legendary **SID chip** of the Commodore 64.

## The Art of the Tracker

Transitioning to the C64 meant learning **Goattracker**. Unlike modern DAWs, there are no MIDI imports or visual automation curves. In the world of the SID, music isn't just composed—it’s programmed. Every single note and effect must be entered by hand. It is a slow, technical process, but the results are incredibly rewarding.

## Reimagining "The Feeling"

While I love writing original pieces, I am fascinated by a specific creative challenge: **How would a modern hit sound if it had been written for the SID chip in the 1980s?**
Lost Frequencies' "The Feeling" is a perfect candidate for this—its soaring melodies and driving rhythm provide a great foundation for the unique, "crunchy" character of 8-bit hardware.

## Today’s Surprise

Behind today’s door awaits a special bridge between the modern era and the golden age of computing.

**Listen now to my C64 SID cover of “The Feeling” — reimagined in pure 8-bit form.**

## 🛠️ The Process

Translating modern music into a 40-year-old chip requires a meticulous workflow:

Harmonic Analysis: I often start with MIDI files to map the harmonies, but they are rarely 100% accurate for this medium. I spend hours refining by ear to correct ghost notes and timing.

Voice Management: The biggest hurdle is translating complex, multi-layered modern productions into the C64’s strict three-voice limitation. I have to decide which elements are essential to the song's soul.

Texture Design: I hand-craft waveforms and pulse-width modulations to ensure the 8-bit sounds carry the same "weight" and presence as high-end modern synthesizers.

How This C64 SID Cover Was Made

I usually start by building the foundation of the track: the bassline and the drums. On the first channel, bass drum and bass share the same instrument — a very typical way of working on the C64 SID. This channel provides the groove and low-end backbone of the song.

The second channel is used for the chords, programmed as arpeggios. At the beginning, they are played very fast in a classic C64 SID style. Later in the song, I switch to slower arpeggios with single notes, where each note is clearly separated so you can hear the spacing between them.

On the third channel, I play the lead sound, which carries the main melody. In this cover, the lead effectively replaces the singer’s voice.

As the track develops, I add a subtle snare. To enhance the rhythm, I also mix in a noise-based arpeggio sound on every second beat, combined with a very short pulse-wave hit.

All instruments in Goattracker have to be programmed by hand. I often reuse instruments I created in the past and then tweak and adapt them specifically for the song until they fit the arrangement and mood perfectly.

## Sharing the Craft

This obsession with 8-bit hardware has resonated with a wonderful community. My YouTube channel, [Nordischsound](https://youtube.com/Nordischsound), has grown to over 5,000 subscribers. Beyond just sharing music, I host tutorials there to teach others how to navigate Goattracker and coax those iconic sounds out of the hardware.
